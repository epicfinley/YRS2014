3: Outputs


Ascii image to text converter: (could use to turn encrypted text into an image)
    Converts images into text using ascii characters (looks at RGB vals for each pixel, converts using ascii).
    I: Image URL/link such as 'D:\images\image1.png' (will need to change this possibly, can we data stream images?)
    O: A string of characters.
    
Ascii text to image converter: (could use to turn encrypted images back into encrypted text)
    Converts text into images (text ascii values are used as RGB vals for each pixel).
    I: string, save location and name such as 'D:\images\image1.png', file type such as 'PNG'
    O: saves the image to the specified location.
    
Morse code 2 way converter: (possible extra functino for the website)
    Converts characters to Morse code and vice versa. Checks to see whether the string is Morse or charactesr first.
    I: string (Characters or Morse)
    O: string (Morse or Characters)
    
text to binary converter:  (possible extra functino fo rthe website)
    Converts inputted text into binary (just 0s and 1s). NOTE: currently no inverse converter.
    I: string (Characters)
    O: string (Binary)
    
NOTE: Reccomended to use the 4 converters above. The old ones work buth their problems are explained as comments
      at the start of the file. Best to use these new converters.
